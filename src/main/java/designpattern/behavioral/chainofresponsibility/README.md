This example is a bit different from the canonical version of the pattern given by various authors. Most of the pattern examples are built on the notion of looking for the right handler, launching it and exiting the chain after that. But here we execute every handler until there's one that **can't handle** a request. Be aware that this still is the Chain of Responsibility pattern, even though the flow is a bit different.
